    <h2>Introduction to investing</h2>
    <p> 
    Investing can be an effective way to put your money to work and potentially build wealth. When I first started earning a salary I thought to myself 'what should I do with this money now' which then brought me across the idea of investing with the aim of generating more money. I also often wondered how were people able to afford supercars and mansions when I was only making enough to pay for basic living necessities.</p>
    
    <h2>How do people invest?</h2>
    If your like me and your curiosity often wonders how wealthy people invest their money and what should I do with my income you've come to the right place as this blog will save you time researching the interenet.<br><br>From what Iv'e discovered there are numerous ways to invest with three over arching investments which inlcude property investments, investing in financial assets and investing in personal businesses which has been discussed below.</p>

    <h2>Purchase Assets over Liabilities</h2>
    <p>Purchasing assets compared with liabilites is the number one most important concepts of gaining financial freedom. A common saying goes"an asset puts money in your pocket, while on the other hand, a liability is something that drains money from your pockets. An example of assets could include rental properties and dividend paying stocks. And an example of a liabilities could include expensive material possesions and depreciating cars.

    <h2>Why do people invest and why should you invest?</h2>
    <p>Investing in income producing assets that consistently generate recurring cashflow, over time will eventually allow you to live the life you desire without the constant pressure of worrying about money. After accumilating a protfolio of cashflowing assets you will have the ability to have more opportunities that life offers and the freedom to choose what you want to do with your time.<br><br>In New Zealand, the media in the financial sector are constantly stating that Kiwis have poor financial literacy which has begun to slowly influence society to believe that this is true. It is important you don't let other people's negative opinions influence your behaviour with investing as it is likely these people are insecure about their own limiting beliefs about life, so therefore try to aim to develop the skill to recognize and ignore these comments.
