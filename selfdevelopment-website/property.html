        <h2>How do you make money with property</h2>

For example, if the property costs $600,000 you will need to have saved $120,000 (20% of the purchase price). However, under some circumstances there are exemptions to LVR restrictions with lending loans to buyers with lower deposits 10% - 20%, so talk to your bank or a mortgage adviser if you have a substantial deposit saved but is still below the 20% requirement. </p>

        <h2> Five tips for getting your deposit together </h2>
