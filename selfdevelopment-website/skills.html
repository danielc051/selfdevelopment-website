        <h2>Educating yourself</h2>
        <p>There is a saying that goes knowledge is power, this is because it gives you the ability like reasoning and problem solving. It is important to continually educate yourself to broaden your capabilites, increase career opportunities, make more informed decisions, will allow you to uphold meaningful conversations and the knowledge you gain will be with you forever. </p>

        <h2>Earn with your mind, not with your time</h2>
        <p>Working hard is a great skill to develop, but if your trying to achieve a high income working more hours or picking up a second job is'nt always the best solution.

It is really important to consider what industires and job positions might be replaced by artificial intelligence in order to be needed in the job marketplace. </p>
