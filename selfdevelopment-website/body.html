        <h2>Introduction to body</h2>
        <p>In life, the number one most important thing is health. Have you ever had a sore tooth or something in your eye and at that point in time all you care about is fixing that problem, cause I have.</p>

        <h2>Goal Setting</h2>
        <p>In order to achieve your desired outcome it is highly important that before starting your fitness journey you construct some goals and develop a plan to help you stay on track. It is vital that you ask yourself, 'why do I want to embark on this fitness/health journey'.<br><br>  I would recommend determining if you want to loose weight, maintain weight or gain weight which will be a deciding factor when structuring your goals.This is because it will enable you to understand if you should be eating less (calorie deficit), eating the same (calorie maintenance), or eating more (carlorie surplus). </p>

        <h2>Create a commitment contract with yourself</h2>
        <p>A beneficial way of staying on track is by physically writing down your goal and tracking your progress. Creating a SMART goal might be a useful way to help you clarify your giving you better results. SMART is an abbreviation which stands for specific, measurable, achievable, relevant and time bound. An example of a fitness goal may be to loose weight and gain muscle. Therefore a smart goal might look like:</p><br>

        <table>
            <tr class="table-head">
                <th>Specific</th>
                <td>In 12 weeks I wont to have lost 6kgs</th>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                <th>Measurable</th>
                <td>I will track my weight every morning in a journal before breakfast and take progress photos every Sunday morning</td>
            </tr>
  
            <tr>
                <th>Achieveable</th>
                <td>I will track my daily food intake with the myfitnesspal app and do four weight seesions per week while walking 10,000 steps per day</td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                <th>Relevant </th>
                <td>Every sunday I will review my journal and progress photos to see if changes need to be made </td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                <th>Time bound</th>
                <td>This is because I am travelling overseas in 12 weeks and want to feel confident about my body when I get photos taken of myself</td>
            </tr>
  

              
          </table>

        <h2>Understanding nutrition</h2>
        <p>Staying active will be a contributing factor on your health journey however, more importantly is what your putting into your body. For example, if your goal is to loose weight and you are eating over your calorie maintenance all your hard work will be for nothing as you will be in a clorie surplus.</p>

        <h2>Staying active</h2>
        <p>Whether going to the gym, doing cardio or joining a new sports team staying active is super important to your health. Staying active will allow you to increase your cardiovascular fintess, help manage weight, strengthen bones and muscles, and lets your body release endorphins improving your well-being. </p>

        <h2>Recovery</h2>
        <p>Another key aspect of your journey is rest and recovery. Ensuring you get optimal recovery will allow your body the time to repair and strengthen itself in between workouts. A general framwork is sleeping from between 7- 9 hours and have atleast one rest day per week from resisitence training.</p>
        
        <h2>Consistency</h2>
        <p>The number one reason people fail or give up on there goals is because they aren't consistent and dont see reults. By staying on track and trusting the process time will come and eventually through all your hard work and discipline it will all pay off leaving you feeling content.</p>

        <h2>Start now</h2>
        <p>Theres a famous quote the resonates with this page which goes "the best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago, the second best time is today". This means that although you might feel that it's to late, your too old, or that you'll start taking care of your health when it's Januray 1st you simply shouldn't wait and start today. </p>
