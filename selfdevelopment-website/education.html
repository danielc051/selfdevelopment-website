        <h2>Introduction to education</h2>
        <p>In todays world people always say "you should invest in yourself" and you may wonder well what does this mean. Investing in yourself might mean developing your knowledge and increasing your personal skillset. On this page I have discovered the most useful books, websites, and useful skills to learn in order to create the life you want.</p>

        <h2>Education alone isn't enough</h2>
        <p>Developing your skillset and increasing your knowledge is highly important but ultimately taking action towards your goal is the only way to get where you want.  </p>

        <h2>Getting uncomfortable</h2>
        <p>Trying to learn new skills can be challenging. Everyone has to start somewhere so by setting goals, staying consistent and building up self discipline this will help you stay motived when your only motivator is you. </p>

        <h2>How to educate yourself</h2>
        <p>In order to educate yourself and develop your knowledge you will need to obtain information from sources which could include books, courses, podcasts, video content, online resources and learning by doing. Athough free content can be beneficial, purchasing a course or book and putting some skin in the game will force you to complete it. This is because you will simply wamt tp gain value from the money you spent.</p>

        <h2>Best self development books</h2>
        <p>Below I have constructed a list of my all time favourite books on personal finance, happieness & wealth, selling, entrepuenership, and property investing:</p><br>

        <h2>Websites to purchase books online</h2>
        <p>A common phrase said is that 'knowledge is power' and reading is a great way to increase your knowledge and learn new perspectives of different authors. I know that some people enjoy going to book stores and choosing out physical books, however if your wanting to save time purcahsing a kindle or e-reader can save you a tonne of time and less physical storage space is required because the books will be stored digitally in your e-library. For those that like using a physical book, the most useful website to purchase books online in New Zealand have been listed below:<br><br>
            <ul>
                <li>Book despository</li>
                <li>Mightyape</li>
                <li>Fish pond</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>Useful websites for online courses </h2>
        <p>If your wanting to change career path, learn new hobbie or simply wanting to learn something new online courses can be a great way to advance your skill set. Online courses have allowed education to be cost effective, time flexible, increase variety of courses, and given people the ability to learn within the comfort of their own home. Some awesome websites are listed below:<br><br>
            <ul>
            <li>Udemy</li>
            <li>Coursea</li>
            <li>Skillshare</li>
            <li>Google skillshop</li>
            <li>Linkedin learning</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>Podcasts & audiobooks</h2>
        <p>Another great form of content that can increase your knowledge is by listening to informative podcasts and audiobooks. One of the benefits of audiobooks and podcasts is that you can listen to them while doing physical activities saving you time, increasing your listening ability, stimulates critical thinking, expands your perspectives and allows you to increase your intelligence. For example, you could listen to audiobooks while your at the gym, travelling to work, and cleaning your house. Some great websites have been listed below:<br><br>
            <ul>
            <li>Audible</li>
            <li>Spotify</li>
            <li>iheart radio</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
